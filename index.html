    <p>
      Croissants are delicious, flaky pastries that originated in France. They
      are made from buttery, layered dough that is rolled and folded many times
      to create their famous light texture. Croissants are usually enjoyed for
      breakfast, served plain or filled with chocolate, ham and cheese, or jam.
      Their golden color and soft inside make them a favorite in cafés all
      around the world.
